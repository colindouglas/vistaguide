## R Markdown

```{r cars}
peninsula_codes <- c("B3H" = "South End", 
                     "B3J" = "Downtown", 
                     "B3K" = "North End", 
                     "B3L" = "West End")

listings %>%
  filter(postal_first %in% names(peninsula_codes), city == "Halifax") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sqft_mla, y = price)) +
  #geom_point(aes(color = substring(postal_first, 1, 2))) +
  geom_point(aes(color = postal_first)) +
  #labs(color = "", x = "Square Footage (MLS)", y = "List Price") +
  labs(color = "", x = "", y = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = peninsula_codes)

listings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = postal_first)) +
  geom_bar()
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
